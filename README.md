This is a small example how to use ordered broadcasts.
The example has 2 buttons:
1. Press on the first button and both receivers will accpet the broadcast
2. Press on the second button and the first receiver will abort the broadcast, thus it will not pass to the 2nd receiver

Notice: the priority in the AndroidManifest.xml file for each broadcast
